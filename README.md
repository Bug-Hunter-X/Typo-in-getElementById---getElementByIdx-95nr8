This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in JavaScript when working with HTML elements. The bug arises from a simple typo in the `getElementById` method, which is frequently used to select HTML elements by their ID. The correct method is `getElementById`, but a common typo is `getElementByIdx` which results in a runtime error. The solution demonstrates the correct usage.
